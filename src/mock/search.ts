      "\"If you can't respect the basic fundamental underlying principles with which we order society — which is 'Do not steal' — then what are you left with?\" asks investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Following her TED2025 talk, Cadwalladr is in conversation with Chris Anderson, head of TED, to warn about surveillance fascism. What happens when big Silicon Valley companies take over communication platforms and weaponize intellectual property against you? She suggests that when you feel powerless, it's often actually because you are powerful — and explores why it's so important to fight information chaos by supporting independent media and journalists.",

Wendy Whelan, associate artistic director of the New York City Ballet, joins him on stage for a rendition of “The Carnival of the Animals,” exploring how the cuckoo bird exemplifies the cycles of inaction that lead to injustice. It's more than a performance — it's a reckoning. ",

    description:
      'An accomplished cellist, TED Fellow Joshua Roman has practiced his instrument daily since he was a child — until a severe case of long COVID almost robbed him of his ability to play. In an inspiring talk, he plays a piece by Johann Sebastian Bach, shares how he found his way back to music and then performs a staggering new solo composition, titled "Immunity."',
